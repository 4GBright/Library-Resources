To get quote from a particular person
import quote from the crawler module
and give the name of the person as parameter

eg: from crawler import quote
    x = quote_by("Elon Musk")

the crawler module is used for only the quote_by fuc

DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING IN THE crawler module

however quote_by fuc returns only 10 results
to increase the results go to the crawler module
and navigate to the "quote" fuction
change the limit parameter to required number
